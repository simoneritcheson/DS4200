  <body>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Simone Ritcheson, and I am a third year at Northeastern University 
        studying Data Science and Communications. I just finished my first co-op at 
        DraftKings working on the Fraud team and am looking for summer internships 
        now. I am interested in Machine Learning, Data Visualization, and AI! I also
        love dogs! </p>
